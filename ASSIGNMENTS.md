Here are 20 tasks to help you practice JavaScript variables, operators, conditional statements, and loops. These are a mix of practical and theoretical tasks:

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Variables & Data Types**

1. **Create a variable to store your name, age, and whether you're a student. Print them to the console.**
2. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript?**
3. **Declare three different types of variables: a number, a string, and a boolean. Use `typeof` to display their types.**
4. **Explain what happens when you try to assign a value to a `const` variable after itâ€™s been declared.**

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Operators**

5. **Write an expression using arithmetic operators that evaluates to 25.**
6. **Demonstrate the difference between `==` and `===` with an example.**
7. **Use assignment operators (`+=`, `*=`, etc.) to manipulate a variable's value.**
8. **What is the result of the expression: `5 + '5'` and why?**

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Conditional Statements**

9. **Write an if-else statement to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.**
10. **Create a program that takes a user's age and checks if they are old enough to vote (18+).**
11. **Write a condition to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.**
12. **What is the purpose of the `else if` block in conditional statements? Provide a scenario.**

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Loops**

13. **Write a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.**
14. **Create a `while` loop that prints even numbers between 2 and 20.**
15. **Use a loop to calculate the factorial of a number (e.g., 5! = 120).**
16. **Explain the difference between a `for` loop and a `do...while` loop.**

---

### ðŸ”¸ **Combining Concepts**

17. **Write a program that asks for a number and prints whether itâ€™s odd or even using a loop and condition.**
18. **Create a loop that sums numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result.**
19. **Using a loop and condition, print all numbers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 7.**
20. **Write a program that prints the multiplication table (1 to 10) for a given number.**
